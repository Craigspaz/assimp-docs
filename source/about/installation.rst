************
Installation
************

The Assimp-Lib can be used in two ways:

* Using it by installing pre-built libraries 
* Integrate the library into your project via cmake.

Both ways are descriped at `Build instructions <https://github.com/assimp/assimp/blob/master/Build.md>`_

Usage
-----

When you're done integrating the library into your IDE/project, you can now start using it. There are two separate
interfaces by which you can access the library: a C++ interface and a C interface using flat functions. While the former
is easier to handle, the latter also forms a point where other programming languages can connect to. Up to the moment, though,
there are no bindings for any other language provided. Have a look at the `Usage <_ai_access_cpp>` for a detailed
explanation and code examples.
